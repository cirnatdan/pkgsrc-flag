The xhyve hypervisor is a port of bhyve to OS X. It is built on top of
Hypervisor.framework in OS X 10.10 Yosemite and higher, runs entirely
in userspace, and has no other dependencies. It can run FreeBSD and vanilla
Linux distributions and may gain support for other guest operating systems
in the future.
